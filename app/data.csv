The series has been serialized biweekly on Shueisha's Shōnen Jump+ application and website since March 2019, with the chapters collected in eleven tankōbon volumes as of April 2023.

By March 2023, Spy × Family had over 30 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series. The series has been praised for its storytelling, comedy, and artwork.
In order to maintain the state of peace between the rival nations of Westalis and Ostania,[a] a Westalian agent code-named ""Twilight"" is tasked with spying on Donovan Desmond, leader of the National Unity Party within Ostania. However, due to Desmond being notoriously reclusive, the only way Twilight can get close to him is to enroll a child in the same private school as Desmond's sons and pose as a fellow parent.
To accomplish this and present the image of a happy family, he creates the alias of Loid Forger, adopts a young orphan girl named Anya, and marries a woman named Yor Briar. However, unbeknownst to him Anya can read minds and Yor is in fact a professional assassin. Neither Loid nor Yor are aware of each other's true identities, or that Anya knows their true professions. The family later takes in a dog with precognitive abilities whom they name Bond. Despite these unknown factors and Twilight's occasional lapses of common sense due to years of being a spy, he must learn to play the role of the perfect father and husband in order to carry out his mission.
Tatsuya Endo and his editor Shihei Lin have known each other for over ten years; Lin was his initial editor on his first serial Tista (2007).[7] When Lin was moved from the Jump Square editorial department to Shōnen Jump+, Endo happily followed, and they began developing a new work. Spy × Family takes elements from three of Endo's Jump Square one-shots: Rengoku no Āshe (煉獄のアーシェ, lit. ""Ashe of Purgatory""), Ishi ni Usubeni, Tetsu ni Hoshi (石に薄紅、鉄に星, lit. ""The Pink in Stone, the Star in Steel""), and I Spy. Lin said that its reception among the editorial department was so good that serialization was practically decided before the official meeting was even held.[7]
The initial draft was given a working title of Spy Family written in Japanese. When deciding the final name, Endo came up with over 100 options, but they ultimately decided to use the same title but in English and with a ""cross"" in between, the latter influenced by Hunter × Hunter.[7] Lin said that he and Endo are always conscious of the line where violence, a necessary aspect in a spy manga, is given a pass for comedy's sake. With Tista and Blade of the Moon Princess both having a dark tone, the editor told Endo to give Spy × Family a more cheerful one. Anya was inspired by the main character of Rengoku no Ashe. Her extrasensory perception was decided early on, and Lin cited its use for comedic effect as one of the series' strengths. Lin said that the series has a broad readership among all ages and genders. He also cited Endo's clean art and ability to convey emotions as part of the manga's appeal.[7]
Lin feels that the world and characters were firmly established as of volume two. As such, he revealed that he and Endo would start to include longer narratives in the series.[7]
Written and illustrated by Tatsuya Endo, Spy × Family has been serialized biweekly on the Shōnen Jump+ application and website since March 25, 2019.

She had strong praise for Endo's art; writing that ""Action-comedy is no mean feat even in animated or live-action mediums. To pull it off so well in still images takes real artistic talent.""

Morgana Santilli of The Beat stated that Spy × Family volume one does an excellent job balancing fun espionage action with heartwarming family moments.

Santilli compared its comedy to that of From Eroica with Love, another Cold War-centric series.[99] In a review for Polygon, Julia Lee stated that Endo takes a premise that could make a ""typical, corny, action manga"" and uses it to make one of the funniest series out right now. Like the other reviewers, Lee praised Endo's art, writing that he has a knack for action scenes, as well as ""expressive panels that really show you how the characters are feeling.""[100]
